###################################
Recreate Deployment
###################################
How it works: The old version is completely taken offline, and the new version is deployed.
Benefits:
Simpler to implement.
Challenges:
Downtime during deployment.

###################################
A/B Testing
###################################
How it works: A subset of users is directed to the new version (B), while others remain on the 
old version (A). Performance and user experience are compared before full rollout.
Benefits:
Data-driven decision-making.
Can test user preferences.
Challenges:
Requires sophisticated traffic routing and analytics.

###################################
Shadow Deployment
###################################
How it works: The new version runs alongside the old version but does not serve live user traffic. 
Real-world traffic is mirrored to the new version for testing.
Benefits:
Safe validation of new functionality.
No impact on users.
Challenges:
Requires additional infrastructure for shadow traffic.

###################################
Feature Toggles (Feature Flags)
###################################
How it works: New features are deployed but remain hidden behind toggles. They can be activated 
for selected users or fully rolled out later.
Benefits:
Allows for gradual rollouts.
Easier rollbackâ€”simply disable the feature.
Challenges:
Complexity in managing flags.
Technical debt if flags are not removed after use.
Key Considerations for Choosing a Deployment Strategy:
Application type: Critical services may need gradual rollouts, while simple updates may be fine 
with recreate deployment.
Infrastructure: Does your environment support dynamic traffic routing or multiple environments?
Rollback requirements: Some strategies (e.g., Blue-Green) make rollback easier.
Downtime tolerance: How much downtime is acceptable for your users?
Monitoring and Feedback: Effective monitoring tools are essential, especially for Canary or
Rolling deployments.
